    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/?utm_source=ind&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=pr2023sep">Freshworks</a> (NASDAQ: FRSH) announced that Jupiter Money, one of the pioneering money management apps in the country, uses <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/?utm_source=ind&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=pr2023sep">Freshdesk™ </a> and <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/live-chat-software/?utm_source=ind&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=pr2023sep">Freshchat™</a> to deliver best-in-class support to its customers. Jupiter Money chose Freshworks because it is easy to use, automates agent processes, and integrates with existing CRM and commerce systems – added value that has helped Jupiter earn customer trust and satisfaction in a challenging market.
            <br><br>
Operational since 2019, Jupiter Money aims to make finance simple, especially for the younger population of the country, who lead a digital way of life. Jupiter boasts over 800,000 customers in just three years of being operational. Customer experience and reliable support are important in the finance industry, and Jupiter Money wanted to set the benchmark in support. They chose not to outsource customer support, which is a common practice with banks, and Freshworks software made it easy for Jupiter to do in-house support. 
<br><br>
“We have been using Freshworks software since day one. With tough regulatory requirements and a need for high-quality software, Freshworks was our first choice since we went live to the public in 2019.” says <b> Nikhil Godbole, Group Customer Service Head at Jupiter.</b>  “Apart from seamless onboarding, the simplicity of new-hire training and the many app integrations that the software offered were quick wins for the team.” 
<br><br>
Using Freshchat, Jupiter’s 350 agents respond to customers in 20 seconds or less. Once the Ticket is assigned and later closed, a CSAT survey is sent out to the customer. Rapid, omnichannel support has helped Jupiter increase CSAT to 88%-- metrics that are built right into the analytics dashboard.
<br><br>
“Freshworks’ speed is great. Once you set an automation rule, it is good to go. If you are a brand looking to boost productivity, you should go for it,” advocates <b> Godbole.</b> 
<br><br>
Freshworks also seamlessly integrates with Jupiter’s other business critical systems used by engineering to get tickets requiring product support resolved faster. Integrations with Ozonetel for telephony (contact center solution), integration for social support, Knowmax for knowledge base have helped avoid silos and make Freshdesk the central nerve center of Jupiter's support philosophy. 
<br><br>
“As long-term business software providers, trust and customer satisfaction backed by simplicity are a part of our philosophy. So when we work with customers who mirror the same for their customers, success speaks for itself. Jupiter Money is writing an exciting new chapter for digital banking in India, and we are glad to be on the front row, getting the <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/customers/case-study/jupiter-money-86-csat-freshdesk/?utm_source=ind&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=pr2023sep">brand to an a 88% CSAT</a> and beyond,” said <b> Karthik Rajaram, Vice President of Sales, India at Freshworks. </b>
